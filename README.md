# Charity Blockchain Project
## Problem Statement

* There are no platforms that can be used by charities to ensure security while providing accessibility to maximum people.
* The biggest problem faced is transparency, where people can rightly exercise their Right To Information by asking for a record of expenditure by the charity
* Even if such applications are available, they are inaccessible to smaller organisations with a good user interface for ease of access.
  
## Requirements of the Project

* Solidity Web3
    * Solidity provides Inheritance properties in contracts including multiple level inheritance properties.
* Metamask
    * To have an easy-to-use and secure wallet service, the platform connects to users' MetaMask automatically.
* Node.js
    * Node.js is used a backend for our application. It records transactions communicates between the Applications and integrates frontend.
* Ganache
    * Ganache provides the GUI-based local Ethereum blockchain development environment to deploy and test contracts.

## Project Working 

* A metamask connection is required to run the application for any transaction.
* A ganache RPC Server is run with metamask as the wallet, using the node.js interface.
* Charity and organisation details are saved in the application, and a hash value is generated
* A transaction is carried out, between organisation and charity and transaction hash is generated for each transaction
* A block is created, when the user mines all the transactions updates.
